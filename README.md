## How to run: ##

    * To run the lab by itself and make it interactive, type 'make'

    * To run the testing with all the commands, type 'make test'

    * To test that we make sure the file is in the directory, type 'make studs && make' (This command changes the name 'students.txt' to 'studs.txt' and runs the lab)

    * To run again with the students.txt, type 'make students && make' (This command changes the name back 'studs.txt' to 'students.txt' and runs the lab)
